This project my team and I looked at various data sets.
We hoped to discover potential relationships between emissions and other variables.
I worked on Emissions data by country in a standalone fashion and with pollution deaths
No linear correlation was found between emissions and air pollution deaths.
A very interesting story developed when looking at the emissions data accross time.
